## Summary

The task at hand was to develop a timed fish feeding system. This would combine all of the skills from the pertaining cluster. We combined the use of a servo, the 14 segment display and the ESP32 to accomplish this. The code initializes the display and the pertaining pins. An initial design consisted of setting a countdown timer of 15 seconds through the use of modulus. Once the time passes, a function to activate the servo is called with a vTaskDelay between shifts.  

Investigative questions: 
    What approach can you use to make setting the time interval dynamic (not hard coded)? Elaborate.

     Infrared sensor values normally fluctuate in variant light conditions.  

	When objects pass within the range, the light waves detect those objects and reflect the presence back to the sensor. Their wavelengths are less than that of microwaves.  While theyâ€™re able to detect motion, they can also measure the emission of heat by an object.In order to make the time interval dynamic, there could be several approaches. For instance, one could take in a user input to 
    change the intervals that they desire when they initialize the product. Another approach could be with the implementation of more 
    sensors to decide how the program should decide when to feed the animals. These could be sensors for daylight or by the weight of 
    the container (checking how much food is left).

## Solution Design

The solution design was aimed towards maintaining a clean, simple and efficient look. Aside from that the design followed the one instructed from the Alphanumeric I2C Display with the added servo.

## Supporting Artifacts

This video is presents the original concept for counting down to activate the servo:
 
<div style="text-align: center">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">
                    <img src="https://github.com/gramos0211/Team1-Birol-Ramos-Sable/blob/master/quest-1/images/servoandcountdown.gif"/>
            </td>  
      </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

It counts down in 15 second intervals and then "shakes" the container by rotating the servo 3 times.
